# CompTIA_Pentest+

This are my notes that i make to prepare for my pentest+ exam. I'm using obsidian as note taking app so all the syntax are obsidian based. 

The notes contain the main concepts that chapter/domain and a additional information page that contain extra info that i learn while doing the practice question from sybex

So you are welcome to download and make changes to the notes as you like, if there are any question you can issue a issue or message me, welcome to hear feedback.

Below i will talk about my experience about taking the exam and tips


## Timeline

I decided to take the exam at 03/09/2021 

So i bought dion traning penetest+ course and start learning

After finishng the video, i start doing the sybex practice question book chapter by chapter

And after that i schedule my exam date at 21/10/2021

1 week before the exam, i also bought dion traning pentest+ practice question at udemy to practice more

and that's about it for the timeline 

## Study Route

If you are a reader learner i dont have any recommandation, since im a audio/video learner, personally i did not bought the study guide from sybex 

If you are a audio/video learner i would definitely recommand dion traning pentest+ courses, jason did a very good job of giving us a summary and baseline to learn

For practice question i would absolutely recommand the sybex book (but i don't like the book, i will talk about why)

I would also recommand the practice exam that dion training has as well, its has 6 set of practice exam question

With that you should have enough knowledge to go take the exam

If you want to test your knowledge you can try examtopic pentest+ questions, but alot of the answers are wrong, so it's good practice to check the discussion

PS (Alot of the questions are similar to the sybex book question)

## My Experience

The sybex book is great that it covers multiple category and it include tons of questions but some of the answers to the questions are kinda bs, where some answers are clearly wrong, so i would recommand googling the question, generally you should be able to find discussion on examtopic and look at people's opinion 

As for the exam, i don't really have a problem with it, it's just that some questions are related to the sybex book, but the real world answer are different compare to the textbook answer, which kinda sucks. It kinda force you to choose the textbook answer instead of the real world answer so that you don't risk failing your exam. So my opinion is that, hope you don't have bad luck with questions on the exam day.

And that's my experience with pentest+ if you have any question feel free to text me or issue a issue on github i will try to reply. Thanks for reading. ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ
