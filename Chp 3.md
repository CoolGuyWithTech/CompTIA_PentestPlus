## Additional Information

NBTStat Code <20> means ==Server==

NBTStat Code <00> means ==Workstation==

To prevent DNS poisoning attack use DNSSEC

VNC can remote into any system if they are install in the system

Windows use Task Scheduler and at to run task automatically	

PsExec can run only if the **ADMIN$** and **SERVICES** share is open

Using SAN Subject Alternative Name can provide extended site validation

Windows you can use **at** and **task scheduler** to schedule task
