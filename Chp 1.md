## Planning a Pentest

| Scope                      | Why                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Budgeting                  | The budget will determine the scope if the test                  |
| Resources and requirements | This will determine if there things that is require for the test |
| Communication Path         | How do we communicate and when                                   |
| End State                  | How do we end the test and what is submitted after the testing   |
| Technical Constraints      | What is off limits                                               |
| Disclaimer                 | The testing is only accurate for a certain amount of time        | 

<br>

## Rule of Engagement
| Rules            | Why                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Timeline         | How long will it be tested  |
| Location         | In-site or offsite          |
| Time Restriction | When can we test the system |
| Transparency     | Who will know the testing   |
| Boundaries       | What will be tested         |

## Additional Info

Different Location have different law so it depends on the `Interpol regulation`

If during a black box test and the client will provide information then its very little information

For NAC use Certificate Pinning to access the internal server (Associate Host with public key is certificate pinning or PKI)

Pentester should contact the client when there is ==critical finding==, ==indicator of prior compromise== and ==server become unresponsive==

Most important thing in engagement is company policy and tolerance impact

To get hired by a security agency you need to sign NDA and non-complete agreement
