## General Terms

Trusted Agent -	Is someone in the target organization that the pentesting team has a direct line communication with

Salting - the act of including a random value so it makes it harder to crack the password

Key Stretching - Make a hash go through multiple hash function

## Multi factor authentication Factors
-	Something you have (Physical/Hardware)
-	Something you know (Knowledge Based)
-	Something you are (Biometric)
-	Something you do (Action?)

## SQL Injection Prevention Methods
-	Sanitize User Data: ensure that data is the expected type 
-	Escape Data: To ensure that the data will not be read as code
-	Parameterize Queries: Have prepare statement for the database, the SQL Code its static

## Active Directory Tools
-	Group Policy Management

## Additional Information

Recommendation should be put in the conclusion part of the report

If there's destructive way to destroy the sensitive media then go for it

FTPS instead of FTP
SSH instead of Telnet
SCP instead of RCP

If there is a critical finding, then report to the client immediately 

Risk Appetite should be put in findings
