## Additional Info

Belkin is a router company (WAP Wireless Access Point)

Telnet Command : telnet **IP Address** **Port**

Certificate Inspection with ==sslyze==

Capture Packet by using ==Wireshark== and ==tcpdump== 

Wireless packet capture: Monitor Mode

Wired packet capture: Promiscuous Mode 

Non-transitional asset are most likely rare-hardware or thing i never head before

DNS Zone Transfer `dig axfr @nameserver target_domain` && `host -t axfr target_domain nameserver`

Use hping to craft a custom packet

==Domain Controller== and ==SCADA Devices== are easily interrupable 

Run test in a lab environment first *proof of concept*

ICS and SCADA and PLC commonly control factory equipment	

Credential Scanning should be with a read-only account 

Check user account `dsquery user -inactive 4`

SCADA is scare of SNMP brute force attack (**due to disruption to the fragile system**)
